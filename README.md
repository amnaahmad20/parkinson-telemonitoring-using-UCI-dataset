*Parkinson's Disease Severity Prediction using Machine Learning*

<font color='87cefa'><b><h1>Project Objective</h1></font></b>
*The objective of this project is to develop a machine learning model that can accurately predict the severity of Parkinson's disease in patients based on various voice and speech attributes. The model will be trained on the Parkinson's Disease Dataset, which contains a range of acoustic features that are indicative of the disease severity. The model's performance will be evaluated using various metrics such as accuracy, mean squared error, and R2 score. The ultimate goal of the project is to develop a reliable and accurate tool that can assist doctors in the early detection and diagnosis of Parkinson's disease, potentially leading to improved patient outcomes.*
<font color='87cefa'><b><h1>Data</h1></font></b>

*The Parkinsons Telemonitoring dataset is a collection of voice recordings and corresponding clinical information from individuals with Parkinson's disease. The dataset was collected using a telemonitoring platform that allowed patients to record their voice while performing simple tasks, such as sustained phonation and vowel phonation. The dataset contains <font color='green'><b>5875</font></b> voice recordings from <font color='green'><b>42</font></b>  individuals with Parkinson's disease and 24 healthy controls.*

a.   Load the dataset and examine the columns, their data types,and any missing values.

b.   Check for any outliers and remove them if necessary.

c. Convert any categorical features to numerical features using one-hot encoding or label encoding.

d. Split the data into training and testing sets.
